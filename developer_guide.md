# Developer guide

This requires LTO feature of avr-gcc which means you need to have
quite recent avr-gcc. We use avr-gcc (GCC) 4.7.0.

## SPI_STC optimization

Every cycle spent in SPI_STC produces 96 cycles every BLANK. Blank
occurs every 2^13 = 8192 cycles. Given clock frequency of f, we get:

    f / 8192 * 96 / f = 96/8192 = 1.17 %

So, one cycle spent in SPI_STC represents over one percent of overall
CPU cycles available on ATmega328p (or any other CPU running BLANK
every 2^13 CPU cycles).

Byte length on wire is 8 times the SPI clock divider. We use divider of 4, which results total cycles in transmit:

    cycles_per_byte = 8 * 4 = 32

In short, optimization really matters. Before starting to optimize,
the handler was consuming 41 cycles. In the far beginning, it was even
longer (haven't counted that). To avoid blocking lower priority
interrupts, we need to get lower than Ì€cycles_per_byte`. Currently 41
is bigger than that, so we are having problems.

Optimization goes on.
